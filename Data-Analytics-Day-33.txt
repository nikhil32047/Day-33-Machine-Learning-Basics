 Topics + Explanations

1. Machine Learning Basics for Analytics

ML helps automate data-driven predictions and insights.

Analysts often use supervised learning (classification, regression) and unsupervised learning (clustering).

Example: Predicting customer churn using past purchase behavior.


2. Linear Regression for Prediction

A statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and independent variables (X).

Formula: Y = a + bX + e (where a is intercept, b is slope).

Example: Predicting sales based on advertising spend.


3. Logistic Regression for Classification

Used when the outcome is categorical (Yes/No, 0/1).

Outputs probabilities between 0 and 1.

Example: Classifying whether an email is spam or not.


4. Clustering with K-Means

An unsupervised learning algorithm to group data into clusters.

Example: Customer segmentation (high-value, medium-value, low-value).


5. Case Study: Predicting Employee Attrition

Using HR data (age, salary, satisfaction, work hours) to predict whether an employee is likely to leave.

Techniques: Logistic Regression + K-Means for segmentation.

Business Value: Helps HR retain talent and reduce hiring costs.
